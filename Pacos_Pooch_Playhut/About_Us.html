  <P style="margin-right:30%; margin-left:30%;" class="body"> Paco's Pooch Playhut is an animal shelter. We aim to make sure every family member of
  ours are able to find suitable homes for themselves and be with happy loving families. We have been working towards this goal for 10 years now.
  We offer many services to our new owners and old alike. We provide activities as well to get our pets accustomed to their new owners and to new environments.
  We also have our leading mascot Paco who gives us inspiration to make sure every pet gets its home. Currently we only have Dogs at the shelter due to us being able to find homes for our pets!</p>
